## Notices
- This UI implementation version of [Chateo UI Kit - Messenger App](https://www.figma.com/community/file/980835105690634391) design. There's a bit different parts though.(no custom keyboard UI, no file, audio chat UI) This version is under MIT license. Feel free to use :)
- Since it's a UI implementation version, there're no working features.
- I'll be working on full featured version with firebase.
